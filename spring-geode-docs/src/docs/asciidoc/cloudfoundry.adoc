[[cloudfoundry]]
== Pivotal CloudFoundry
:images-dir: ./images

In most cases, when you deploy (i.e. "_push_") your Spring Boot applications to Pivotal CloudFoundry (PCF)
you will bind your app to 1 or more instances of the Pivotal Cloud Cache (PCC) service.

In a nutshell, {pivotal-cloudcache-website}[Pivotal Cloud Cache] is a managed version of
{pivotal-gemfire-website}[Pivotal GemFire] running in {pivotal-cloudfoundry-website}[Pivotal CloudFoundry].
When running in or across cloud environments (e.g. PWS, AWS, Azure or GCP), PCC with PCF offers several advantages
over trying to run and manage your own standalone Apache Geode or Pivotal GemFir clusters.  It handles many of
the infrastructure-related, operational concerns so you do not have to.


[[cloudfoundry-cloudcache-multi-instance-target]]
=== Targeting Specific Pivotal Cloud Cache Service Instances

It is possible to provision multiple instances of the Pivotal Cloud Cache service in your Pivotal CloudFoundry
environment. You can then bind multiple PCC service instances to your Spring Boot app.

However, Spring Boot for Apache Geode & Pivotal GemFire (SBDG) will only auto-configure 1 PCC service instance for your
Spring Boot application.  This does not mean it is not possible to use multiple PCC service instances with your
Spring Boot app, just that SBDG only "_auto-configures_" 1 service instance for you.

You must select which PCC service instance your Spring Boot app will auto-configure for you automatically when you have
multiple instances and want to target a specific PCC service instance to use.

To do so, declare the following SBDG property in Spring Boot `application.properties`:

.Spring Boot application.properties targeting a PCC service instance
[source,properties]
----
# Spring Boot application.properties
spring.boot.data.gemfire.cloud.cloudfoundry.service.cloudcache.name=pccServiceInstanceTwo
----

The `spring.boot.data.gemfire.cloud.cloudfoundry.service.cloudcache.name` property tells SBDG which PCC service instance
to auto-configure.

If the named PCC service instance identified by the property does not exist, then SBDG will throw
an `IllegalStateException` stating the PCC service instance by name could not be found.

If you did not set the property and your Spring Boot app is bound to multiple PCC service instances,
then SBDG will auto-configure the first PCC service instance it finds by name, alphabetically.

If you did not set the property and no PCC service instance is found, then SBDG will log a warning.


[[cloudfoundry-cloudcache-multi-instance-using]]
=== Using Multiple Pivotal Cloud Cache Service Instances

If you want to use multiple PCC service instances with your Spring Boot application, then you need to configure
multiple connection `Pools` connected to each PCC service instance used by your Spring Boot application.

The configuration would be similar to the following:

.Multple Pivotal Cloud Cache Service Instance Configuration
[source,java]
----
@Configuration
@EnablePools(pools = {
  @EnablePool(name = "PccOne"),
  @EnablePool(name = "PccTwo"),
  ...,
  @EnablePool(name = "PccN")
})
class PccConfiguration {
  ...
}
----

You would then externalize the configuration for the individually declared `Pools` in Spring Boot
`application.properties`:

.Configuring Pool Locator connection endpoints
[source,properties]
----
# Spring Boot `application.properties`

spring.data.gemfire.pool.pccone.locators=pccOneHost1[port1], pccOneHost2[port2], ..., pccOneHostN[portN]

spring.data.gemfire.pool.pcctwo.locators=pccTwoHost1[port1], pccTwoHost2[port2], ..., pccTwoHostN[portN]
----

NOTE: Though less common, you can also configure the `Pool` of connections to target specific servers in the cluster
using the `spring.data.gemfire.pool.<named-pool>.severs` property.

TIP: Keep in mind that properties in Spring Boot `application.properties` can refer to other properties like so:
`property=${otherProperty}`.  This allows you to further externalize properties using Java System properties
or Environment Variables.

Of course, a client Region is then assigned the Pool of connections that are used to send data to/from
the specific PCC service instance (cluster):

.Assigning a Pool to a client Region
[source,java]
----
@Bean("Example")
ClientRegionFactoryBean exampleRegion(GemFireCache gemfireCache,
        @Qualifier("PccTwo") Pool poolForPccTwo) {

    ClientRegionFactoryBean exampleRegion = new ClientRegionFactoryBean();

    exampleRegion.setCache(gemfireCache);
    exampleRegion.setPool(poolForPccTwo);
    exampleRegion.setShortcut(ClientRegionShortcut.PROXY);

    return exampleRegion;
}
----

You can configure as many Pools and client Regions as needed by your application.  Again, the `Pool` determines
which Pivotal Cloud Cache service instance and cluster the data for the client Region will reside.

NOTE: By default, SBDG configures all `Pools` declared in a Spring Boot, `ClientCache` application to connect to
and use a single PCC service instance.  This may be a targeted PCC service instance when using the
`spring.boot.data.gemfire.cloud.cloudfoundry.service.cloudcache.name` property
as discussed <<cloudfoundry-cloudcache-multi-instance-target,above>>.


[[cloudfoundry-geode]]
=== Hybrid Pivotal CloudFoundry & Apache Geode Spring Boot Applications

Sometimes, it is desirable to deploy (i.e. "_push_") and run your Spring Boot applications in Pivotal CloudFoundry,
but still connect your Spring Boot applications to an externally managed, standalone Apache Geode or Pivotal GemFire
cluster.

Spring Boot for Apache Geode & Pivotal GemFire (SBDG) makes this a non-event and honors its "_little to no code
or configuration changes necessary_" goal, regardless of your runtime choice, "_it should just work!_"

To help guide you through this process, we will cover the following topics:

1. Install and Run PCFDev.
2. Start an Apache Geode cluster.
3. Create a User-Provided Service (CUPS).
4. Push and Bind a Spring Boot application.
5. Run the Spring Boot application.

[[cloudfoundry-geode-pcfdev]]
==== Running PCFDev

For this exercise, we will be using https://pivotal.io/pcf-dev[PCF Dev].

PCF Dev, much like PCF, is an elastic application runtime for deploying, running and managing your Spring Boot
applications. However, it does so in the confines of your local development environment, i.e. your workstation.

Additionally, PCF Dev provides several services out-of-the-box, such as MySQL, Redis and RabbitMQ.  These services
can be bound and used by your Spring Boot application to accomplish its tasks.

However, PCF Dev lacks the Pivotal Cloud Cache (PCC) service that is available in PCF.  This is actually ideal for
this little exercise since we are trying to build and run Spring Boot applications in a PCF environment
but connect to an externally managed, standalone Apache Geode or Pivotal GemFire cluster.

As a prerequisite, you will need to follow the steps outlined in the
https://pivotal.io/platform/pcf-tutorials/getting-started-with-pivotal-cloud-foundry-dev/introduction[tutorial]
to get PCF Dev setup and running on your workstation.

To run PCF Dev, you will execute the following `cf` CLI command, replacing the path to the TGZ file
with the file you acquired from the https://network.pivotal.io/products/pcfdev[download]:

.Start PCF Dev
[source,txt]
----
$ cf dev start -f ~/Downloads/Pivotal/CloudFoundry/Dev/pcfdev-v1.2.0-darwin.tgz
----

You should see output similar to:

 	To deploy a particular service, please run:
 	    cf dev deploy-service <service-name> [Available services: mysql,redis,rabbitmq,scs]
----

To use the `cf` CLI tool, you must login to the PCF Dev environment:

.Login to PCF Dev using `cf` CLI
[source,txt]
----
$ cf login -a https://api.dev.cfdev.sh --skip-ssl-validation
----

You can also access the https://apps.dev.cfdev.sh/[PCF Dev Apps Manager] tool from your Web browser at the following URL:

https://apps.dev.cfdev.sh/

Apps Manager provides a nice UI to manage your org, space, services and apps.  It lets you push and update apps,
create services, bind apps to the services and start and stop your deployed applications, among many other things.

[[cloudfoundry-geode-cluster]]
==== Running an Apache Geode Cluster

Now that PCF Dev is setup and running, we need to start an external, standalone Apache Geode cluster that our Spring Boot
application will connect to and use to manage its data.

You will need to install a {apache-geode-website}/releases/[distribution] of Apache Geode on your workstation.
Then you must set the `$GEODE` environment variable.  It is also convenient to add `$GEODE/bin` to your system `$PATH`.

Afterward, you can launch the Geode Shell (_Gfsh_) tool:

.Running Gfsh
[source,txt]
----
$ echo $GEODE
/Users/jblum/pivdev/apache-geode-1.6.0

$ gfsh
    _________________________     __
   / _____/ ______/ ______/ /____/ /
  / /  __/ /___  /_____  / _____  /
 / /__/ / ____/  _____/ / /    / /
/______/_/      /______/_/    /_/    1.6.0

Monitor and Manage Apache Geode
gfsh>
----

We have conveniently provided the _Gfsh_ shell script used to start the Apache Geode cluster:

.Gfsh shell script to start the Apache Geode cluster
[source,txt]
----
include::{docs-resources-dir}/geode/bin/start-cluster.gfsh[]
----

The `start-cluster.gfsh` shell script starts one Geode Locator and one Geode Server.

A Locator is used by clients to discover and connect to servers in the cluster to manage its data. A Locator
is also used by new servers joining a cluster as a peer member, which allows the cluster to be elastically scaled-out
(or scaled-down, as needed). A Geode Server stores the data for the application.

You can start as many Locators or Servers as necessary to meet the availability and load demands of your application.
Obviously, the more Locators and Servers your cluster has, the more resilient it is to failure.  However, you should
size your cluster accordingly, based on your application's needs since there is overhead relative to the cluster size.

You will see output similar to the following when starting the Locator and Server:

.Starting the Apache Geode cluster

----

Currently, we have not defined any Regions in which to store our application's data:

.No Application Regions
[source,txt]
----
gfsh>list regions
No Regions Found
----

This is deliberate since we are going to let the application drive its schema structure, both on the client (app)
as well as on the server-side (cluster).  More on this below.

[[cloudfoundry-geode-cups]]
==== Creating a User-Provided Service

Now that we have PCF Dev and a small Apache Geode cluster up and running, it is time to create a User-Provided Service
to the external, standalone Apache Geode cluster that we started in <<cloudfoundry-geode-cluster,step 2>>.

As mentioned, PCF Dev offers the MySQL, Redis and RabbitMQ services out-of-the-box.  However, to use Apache Geode
(or Pivotal GemFire) in the same capacity as you would Pivotal Cloud Cache when running in a production-grade,
PCF environment, you need to create a User-Provided Service for the standalone Apache Geode cluster.

To do so, execute the following `cf` CLI command:

.cf cups command
[source,txt]
----
$ cf cups <service-name> -t "gemfire, cloudcache, database, pivotal" -p '<service-credentials-in-json>'
----

NOTE: It is important that you specify the tags ("gemfire, cloudcache, database, pivotal") exactly as shown
in the `cf` CLI command above.

The argument passed to the `-p` command-line option is a JSON document (object) containing the "credentials"
for our User-Provided Service.

The JSON object is as follows:

.User-Provided Service Crendentials JSON
[source,json]
----
{
	"locators": [ "<hostname>[<port>]" ],
	"urls": { "gfsh": "https://<hostname>/gemfire/v1" },
	"users": [{ "password": "<password>", "roles": [ "cluster_operator" ], "username": "<username>" }]
}
----

The complete `cf` CLI command would be similar to the following:

.Example `cf cups` command
[source,txt]
----
cf cups apacheGeodeService -t "gemfire, cloudcache, database, pivotal" \
  -p '{ "locators": [ "10.99.199.24[10334]" ], "urls": { "gfsh": "https://10.99.199.24/gemfire/v1" }, "users": [{ "password": "admin", "roles": [ "cluster_operator" ], "username": "admin" }] }'
----

We replaced the `<hostname>` placeholder tag with the IP address of our external Apache Geode Locator.  The IP address
can be found in the _Gfsh_ `start locator` output above.

Additionally, the `<port>` placeholder tag has been replaced with the default Locator port, `10334`,

Finally, we set the `username` and `password` accordingly.

TIP: Spring Boot for Apache Geode (SBDG) provides template files in the {docs-dir}/src/main/resources directory.

Once the service has been created, you can query the details from the `cf` CLI:

[source,txt]
----
$ cf services
Getting services in org cfdev-org / space cfdev-space as admin...

name                 service         plan   bound apps      last operation   broker

$ cf service apacheGeodeService
Showing info of service apacheGeodeService in org cfdev-org / space cfdev-space as admin...

name:      apacheGeodeService

bound apps:
name            binding name   status             message
boot-pcc-demo                  create succeeded
----

You can also view the "apacheGeodeService" from Apps Manager, starting from the `Service` tab in your org and space:

image::{images-dir}/pcfdev-appsmanager-org-space-services.png[]

By clicking on the "apacheGeodeService" service entry in the table you can get all the service details,
such the bound apps:

image::{images-dir}/pcfdev-appsmanager-org-space-service-boundapps.png[]

Configuration:

image::{images-dir}/pcfdev-appsmanager-org-space-service-configuration.png[]

And so on.

TIP: You can learn more about CUPS in the PCF documentation,
{pivotal-cloudfoundry-docs}/devguide/services/user-provided.html[here].

[[cloudfoundry-geode-app]]
==== Push & Bind a Spring Boot application

Now it is time to push a Spring Boot application to PCF Dev and bind the app to the "apacheGeodeService".

Any Spring Boot `ClientCache` application using SBDG will do.  For this example, we will use
the https://github.com/jxblum/PCCDemo/tree/sbdg-doc-ref[PCCDemo] application, available in _GitHub_.

After cloning the project to your workstation, you must perform a build to produce the artifact to push to PCF Dev:

.Build the PCCDemo app
[source,txt]
----
$ mvn clean package
----

Then, you can push the app to PCF Dev with the following `cf` CLI command:

.Push app to PCF Dev
[source,txt]
----
$ cf push boot-pcc-demo -u none --no-start -p target/client-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

Once the app has been successfully deployed to PCF Dev, you can get app details:

.Details for deployed app
[source,txt]
----
$ cf apps

OK

There are no running instances of this process.
----

You can either bind the PPCDemo app to the "apacheGeodeService" using the `cf` CLI command:

.Bind app to apacheGeodeService using CLI
[source,txt]
----
cf bind-service boot-pcc-demo apacheGeodeService
----

Or, alternatively, you can create a YAML file (`manifest.yml` in `src/main/resources`) containing the
deployment descriptor:

.Example YAML deployment descriptor file
[source,yml]
----
\---
applications:
  - name: boot-pcc-demo
    memory: 768M
    instances: 1
    path: ./target/client-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
    services:
      - apacheGeodeService
    buildpacks:
      - https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack.git
----

You can also use Apps Manager to view app details and un/bind additional services.  Start by navigating to
the `App` tab under your org and space:

image::{images-dir}/pcfdev-appsmanager-org-space-apps.png[]

From there, you can click on the desired app and navigate to the `Overview`:

image::{images-dir}/pcfdev-appsmanager-org-space-app-overview.png[]

You can also review the app `Settings`.  Specifically, we are looking at the configuration of the app once bound to
the "apacheGeodeService" as seen in the `VCAP_SERVICES` _Environment Variable_:

image::{images-dir}/pcfdev-appsmanager-org-space-app-settings-envvars.png[]

This JSON document structure is not unlike the configuration used to bind your Spring Boot,  `ClientCache` application
to the Pivotal Cloud Cache service when deploying the same app to Pivotal CloudFoundry.  This is actually very key
if you want to minimize the amount of boilerplate code and configuration changes when migrating between different
CloudFoundry environments, even https://www.cloudfoundry.org/[Open Source CloudFoundry].

Again, SBDG's entire goal is to simply the effort for you, as a developer, to build, run and manage your application,
in whatever context your application lands, even if it changes later.  If you follow the steps in this documentation,
that goal will be realized.

[[cloudfoundry-geode-app-run]]
==== Running the Spring Boot app

All that is left to do now is run the app.

You can start the PCCDemo app from the `cf` CLI using the following command:

.Start the Spring Boot app
[source,txt]
----
$ cf start boot-pcc-demo
----

Alternatively, you can also start the app from Apps Manager.  This is convenient since then you can tail and monitor
the application log file.

image::{images-dir}/pcfdev-appsmanager-org-space-app-logs.png[]

Once the app has started, you can click the https://boot-pcc-demo.dev.cfdev.sh/[VIEW APP] link
in the upper right corner of the `APP` screen.

image::{images-dir}/PCCDemo-app-screenshot.png[]

You can navigate to any of the application Web Service, Controller endpoints.  For example, if you know the ISBN
of a Book, you can access it from the Web browser:

image::{images-dir}/PCCDemo-app-book-by-isbn-screenshot.png[]

You can also access the same data from the _Gfsh_ command-line tool.  However, the first thing to observe
is that our application informed the cluster that it needed a Region called "Books":

.Books Region
[source,txt]
----
gfsh>list regions
List of regions
---------------
Books


gfsh>describe region --name=/Books
..........................................................
Name            : Books

Non-Default Attributes Shared By Hosting Members

 Type  |    Name     | Value
------ | ----------- | ---------
Region | size        | 1
       | data-policy | PARTITION
----

The PCCDemo app creates fake data on startup, which we can query in _Gfsh_ like so:

.Query Books
[source,txt]
----
gfsh>query --query="SELECT book.isbn, book.title FROM /Books book"
Result : true
Limit  : 100
Rows   : 1

[[cloudfoundry-geode-summary]]
=== Summary

There you have it!

The ability to deploy Spring Boot, Apache Geode or Pivotal GemFire `ClientCache` applications to Pivotal CloudFoundry,
yet connect your app to a externally managed, standalone Apache Geode or Pivotal GemFire cluster.

Indeed, this is will be a useful arrangement and stepping stone for many users as they begin their journey towards
a Cloud-Native platform like Pivotal CloudFoundry (PCF) and using services like Pivotal Cloud Cache (PCC).

Later, when the time comes and your need is very real, you can simply migrate your Spring Boot applications to a fully
managed and production-grade Pivotal CloudFoundry environment and SBDG will figure out what to do, leaving you to focus
entirely on your application.
