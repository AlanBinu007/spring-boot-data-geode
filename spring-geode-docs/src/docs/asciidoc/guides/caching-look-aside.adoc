This guide walks through building a simple Spring Boot application using
{spring-framework-docs}/integration.html#cache[Spring's Cache Abstraction]
backed with Apache Geode as the caching provider.

It is assumed that user is familiar with the Spring programming model.  No prior knowledge of Spring's Cache Abstraction
or Apache Geode is required to utilize caching in your Spring Boot applications.

Let's begin.

[[geode-samples-caching-lookaside-background]]
== Background

Caching is a very effective software pattern for reducing the resource consumption used by your application
as well as to improve efficiency by increasing throughput and reducing latency.

The fundamental premise of caching is, given the same arguments, if a service yields the same results, then it is a
prime candidate for caching.  Indeed, if I am searching for a customer record by account number, and it will always
produce the same customer, then adding caching to the search operation will improve the overall experience.  After all,
the account number may be a form of customer identity. We can save compute resources by keeping the customer's
information in a cache.

While there are different patterns of caching, the caching pattern most often used is called _**Look-Aside Caching**_.

_Look-Aside Caching_ is a pattern of caching where the input of the cacheable operation is used as the key to lookup
the results of the cacheable operation's computation on subsequent invocations using the same input.  With _Look-Aside,
the cache is consulted first when the cacheable operation is invoked, and if the computation with the given input
has already been performed, then the value from the cache is returned. Otherwise, if no value has been cached with
the given input, the cacheable operation is invoked and the result is cached using the input as the key.

For example, I may have a `CustomerService` class that looks up a `Customer` by `AccountNumber`, as so:

.Cacheable CustomerService class
[source,java]
----
@Service
class CustomerService {

  @Cacheable("CustomersByAccountNumber")
  Customer findBy(AccountNumber accountNumber) {
    ...
  }
}
----

If I have already looked up a `Customer` (e.g. "Jon Doe") with a given `AccountNumber` (e.g. "abc123"), then when
the `findBy(..)` method is called with the same `AccountNumber` (i.e. "abc123"), we would expect the same result
(i.e. `Customer` "Jon Doe").

The _Look-Aside Caching_ pattern can be represented in the following diagram:

image::../images/Look-Aside-Caching-Pattern.png[]

In the diagram above, we see that first the caching provider (e.g. Apache Geode) is consulted in #1.  If the result
of the cacheable operation for given input has already been computed and stored in the cache, then the result is
simply returned in #2.

However, if the cacheable operation has never been invoked with the given input, or the previous computation of
the operation expired, or was evicted, then the cacheable operation is invoked (#3).  This cacheable operation may
access some external data source to perform its computation. After the operation completes, it returns the result,
but not before the caching infrastructure stores the result along with the input in the cache (#4). After the result
is cached, the value is returned to the caller (#5). Any subsequent invocation of the cacheable operation with
the same input, should yield the same result, stored in the cache, providing the cache entry (input->result) has not
expire or been evicted.

Spring's {spring-framework-docs}/integration.html#cache[Cache Abstraction] is just that, a very elegant implementation
of the _Look-Aside Caching_ pattern.  Details of how Spring's Cache Abstraction works under-the-hood is beyond the
scope of this document.  In a nutshell, it relies on Spring AOP and proxying and is not unlike Spring Transaction
Management demarcation.

Different caching providers have different capabilities. You should choose the caching provider that gives you
what you require to handle your Use Case and caching needs correctly.

If used appropriately, caching can greatly improve your application's end-user experience.

NOTE: Instead of using {spring-framework-javadoc}/org/springframework/cache/annotation/package-summary.html[Spring's Cache Annotations],
you may instead use JSR-107, JCache API Annotations, which is {spring-framework-docs}/integration.html#cache-jsr-107[supported]
by Spring's Caching Abstraction.

TIP: See Spring Boot's documentation for a complete list of
{spring-boot-docs}/boot-features-caching.html#boot-features-caching-provider[supported caching providers].

[[geode-samples-caching-lookaside-example]]
== Example (with additional background)

To make the effects of Spring's Cache Abstraction using Apache Geode as the cache provider apparent in your application,
we show how to enable and use caching with your application in a very small, simple example.

The example Spring Boot application implements a Counter Service, which simply maintains a collection of named counters.
The application provides a REST-ful Web interface to increment a counter, get the current cached count for a named
counter, and the ability to reset a named counter back to 0.

Typically, caching is used to offset the costs associated with expensive operations, such as disk or network I/O.
Indeed, both an operation's throughput and latency is bound by an I/O operation since compute is many orders
of magnitude faster than disk, network, etc.

While developers have been quick to throw more Threads at the problem, trying to do more work in parallel, this opens
the door to a whole new set of problems (concurrency), usually at the expense of using more resources, which does not
always yield the desired results.

Opportunities for caching, though very simplistic, is often overlooked yet is very effective minimizing the over
utilization of resources through reuse.  In an every increasing Microservices based world, caching will become even
more important.

Of course, you still must tune your cache.  Most caches keep information in memory, and since memory is finite,
you must utilize strategies to manage memory effectively, such as eviction, expiration, or even off-heap for JVM-based
caches.  For example, eviction/expiring entries based on use (Least Recently Used, LRU) is 1 such strategy.

Each caching provider is different in this regard.

[[geode-samples-caching-lookaside-example-counterservice-application]]
=== Counter Service Application

Let's have a look at the Counter Service application.

We start with a simple, Spring Boot, Servlet-based Web application:

.SpringBootApplication
[source,java]
----
include::{samples-dir}/caching/look-aside/src/main/java/example/app/caching/lookaside/BootGeodeLookAsideCachingApplication.java[tags=class]
----

With the `org.springframework.geode:spring-geode-starter` dependency on your application classpath:

.spring-goede-starter dependency
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.geode</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-geode-starter</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

And the `BootGeodeLookAsideCachingApplication` class annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`, you have everything you
need to begin using Spring's _Cache Abstraction_ in your application using Apache Geode as the caching provider.

TIP: You can switch from open source Apache Geode to Pivotal GemFire (PCC) very easily simply by changing
the artifactId from `spring-geode-starter` to `spring-gemfire-starter`.  No configuration or code changes
are necessary.

As an application developer, all you need do is focus on where in your application caching would be useful.

Let's do that.

[[geode-samples-caching-lookaside-example-counterservice-cacheableservice]]
=== Cacheable CounterService

Next, we define the operations our `CounterService` and add caching:

.CounterService
[source,java]
----
include::{samples-dir}/caching/look-aside/src/main/java/example/app/caching/lookaside/service/CounterService.java[tags=class]
----

The primary function of the `CounterService` is to maintain a collection of named counters, incrementing the count
each time a named counter is accessed, return the current (cached) count and reset a named counter.

All operations perform a cache function.  The `@Cacheable` `getCachedCount(:String)` method is our _**look-aside cache**_
operation. That is, the "Counters" cache is consulted for the named counter before the method is invoked. If a count
has already been established for the named counter, then the cached count is returned and the method is not invoked.
Otherwise the `getCachedCount(:String)` method is invoked and proceeds to call the `getCount(:String)` method.

The `@CachePut` annotated `getCount(:String)` method is always invoked, but the result is cached. If a cache entry
already exists, then it is updated (or in this case, replaced). This method always has the effect of incrementing
the counter.

Finally, we have a `@CacheEvict` annotated `resetCache(:String)` method, which will reset the named counter back to 0
and evict the cache entry, starting fresh.

TIP: Each of the Spring's Cache annotations can be replaced with the corresponding JSR-107 - JCache API annotations
as {spring-framework-docs}/integration.html#cache-jsr-107[documented here], and the application will work just the same.

[[geode-samples-caching-lookaside-example-counterservice-controller]]
=== CounterController

Then, we include a Spring Web MVC Controller to access our Counter Service application from a Web browser:

.CounterController
[source,java]
----
include::{samples-dir}/caching/look-aside/src/main/java/example/app/caching/lookaside/controller/CounterController.java[tags=class]
----

Essentially, we just inject our `CounterService` application class and wrap the service operations in Web service
endpoints, accessible by URL using HTTP:

.Example Apache Geode Applications using Spring Boot
|===
| URL | Description

| `/ping` | Heartbeat request to test that our application is alive and running.
| `/counter/{name}` | Increments the "named" counter.
| `/counter/{name}/cached` | Returns the current, cached count for the "named" counter.
| `/counter/{name}/reset` | Resets the count for the "named" counter.

|===

The base URL is `http://localhost:8080`.

After running the `BootGeodeLookAsideCachingApplication` class, if you open a Web browser and navigate to
`http://localhost:8080/ping`, you should see the content "PONG".

[[geode-samples-caching-lookaside-example-counterservice-configuration]]
=== Counter Service Configuration

While Spring Boot for Apache Geode/Pivotal GemFire (PCC), SBDG, takes care of enabling Spring's caching infrastructure
for you, and configuring Apache Geode/Pivotal GemFire (PCC) as a caching provider in the caching infrastructure,
you still must define and declare your individual caches.

No Spring caching provider is fully configured by Spring or Spring Boot for that matter.  Part of the reason for this
is that their are many different ways to configure the caches.

Remember, earlier we mentioned tuning a cache with eviction or expiration policies, perhaps using Off-Heap memory. You
may overflow entries to disk. The caches may be persistent. You might be using a client/server or even a WAN topology
and you might need to configure things like conflation, filters, compression, security (e.g. SSL), and so on.

However, this is a lot to think about and you may just simply want to get up and running as quickly as possible. While
SBDG is not opinionated about this out-of-the-box, we do provide assistance to make this task easy:

.GeodeConfiguration
[source,java]
----
include::{samples-dir}/caching/look-aside/src/main/java/example/app/caching/lookaside/config/GeodeConfiguration.java[tags=class]
----

The only thing of real importance here is the `@EnableCachingDefinedRegions` annotation. This Spring Data
for Apache Geode/Pivotal GemFire (PCC), SDG, annotation is responsible for introspecting our Spring Boot application
on Spring container startup, identifying all the caching annotations (both Spring Cache annotations as wells JSR-107,
JCache annotations) used in our application components, and creating the appropriate caches.

In Apache Geode terminology, each cache identified in 1 of the caching annotations by name, will have an Apache Geode
Region created for it.

In our case, SBDG provides us a `ClientCache` instance by default, so we are creating client `LOCAL`-only Region. The
client "Counters" Region is `LOCAL` since we do not have a server backend running.

However, it would be very simple to convert this application into using a client/server topology.

[[geode-samples-caching-lookaside-example-counterservice-configuration]]
==== Client/Server Configuration

To use the client/server topology, essentially you only need to remove the `shortcut` attribute from the
`@EnableCachingDefinedRegions` annotation (since the default is a client `PROXY` Region), start a Locator/Server
using _Gfsh_ and create the "Counters" Region on the server.

Of course, you technically do not even need to create the "Counters" Region on the server.  You can also leverage
SDG's `@EnableClusterConfiguration(..)` annotation, which will create the server-side, "Counters" Region for you.

After starting a Locator/Server using _Gfsh_:

[source,txt]
----
$ gfsh

ServerOne  | 10.99.199.24(ServerOne:40855)<v1>:1025


gfsh>list regions
No Regions Found
----

You only need to modify your application configuration as follows:

.Using client/server
[source,java]
----
@Configuration
@EnableCachingDefinedRegions
@EnableClusterConfiguration(useHttp = true)
public class GeodeConfiguration { }
----

After starting the application, we will see that the "Counters" Region on the server was created:

."Counters" Region
[source,txt]
----
gfsh>list regions

gfsh>describe region --name=/Counters
..........................................................

We will refer to the client/server approach further below, when running the example.

Refer to Apache Geode's documentation to learn more about the
{apache-geode-docs}/topologies_and_comm/cs_configuration/chapter_overview.html[client/server topology].

== Run the Example

Now, it is time to run the example.

If you are just running in local mode (provided configuration), then start the `BootGeodeLookAsideCachingApplication`
from your IDE, or from the command-line, as is to get started:

.Run `BootGeodeLookAsideCachingApplication` class

----

Then open your Web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/ping`:

image::../images/LookAsideCachingApplication-Ping.png[]

After that, we can create and increment counters, for example:

`http://localhost:8080/counter/A`

**1**

If you constantly hit the refresh button, you will see 2, 3, 4, 5, ... and so on.  While the named counter's (i.e. "A")
new count is be cached, we are not returning the cached value.

If you navigate to:

`http://localhost:8080/counter/A/cached`

The count for the named counter (e.g. "A") will remain fixed on whatever the last count was (e.g. "5").

You can begin a new named counter (e.g. "B") without affecting the exiting named counter (i.e. "A"), by navigating to:

`http://localhost:8080/counter/B`

And refreshing the page multiple times:

**3**

If you navigate to:

`http://localhost:8080/counter/B/reset`

**0**

This resets the count of the counter "B". However, this does not affect the count of counter "A", which we can reassess
by navigating to:

`http://localhost:8080/counter/A/cached`

**5**

This is an extremely simple application, but shows the effects of caching.

[[geode-samples-caching-lookaside-example-run-clientserver]]
==== Running the Example using Client/Server

If you are using the client/server topology, the effect are no different. However, after running the example application
you can evaluate the state of the "Counters" Region using _Gfsh_, like so:

[[geode-samples-caching-lookaside-conclusion]]
== Conclusion

As you have learned, Spring making enabling and using caching in your application really easy.  With SBDG, using
either Apache Geode or Pivotal GemFire (PCC) as your caching provider in Spring's _Cache Abstraction_ is as easy
as making sure `org.springframework.geode:spring-geode-starter` is on your application's classpath.

You now have successfully used _**Look-Aside Caching**_ pattern in your Spring Boot application.

Later we will cover more advanced forms of the _Look-Aside Caching_ pattern (e.g. using Eviction/Expiration policies,
etc) as well as take a look at the other caching patterns, like _Inline Caching_ and _Near Caching_.
