== Samples

This section contains working examples demonstrating how to use Spring Boot for Apache Geode (SBDG) effectively.

Some examples focus on specific Use Cases (e.g. [(HTTP) Session state] caching) while other examples demonstrate how
SBDG works under-the-hood to give users a better understanding of what is actually happening and how to debug problems
with their Apache Geode, Spring Boot applications.
