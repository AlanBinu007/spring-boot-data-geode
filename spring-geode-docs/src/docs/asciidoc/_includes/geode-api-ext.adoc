The Spring Boot for {geode-name} (SBDG) project includes the `org.springframework.geode:apache-geode-extensions` module
to make working with the Apache Geode {apache-geode-javadoc}[APIs] tolerable and useful. While this module is relatively
new, it contains several useful API extensions already. We will continue to add extensions to this module as both SBDG
and users' needs dictate.

{geode-name}'s {apache-geode-javadoc}[API] is quite convoluted with many design problems:

1. Non-intuitive, complex interfaces that often contradict industry standard terms.
(e.g. `Cache` vs. {apache-geode-javadoc}/org/apache/geode/cache/Region.html[`Region`]).
2. APIs with an excessive footprint: no sensible https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type[ADTs] resulting in
too many overloaded methods with loaded method signatures (e.g. {apache-geode-javadoc}/org/apache/geode/cache/Region.html[`Region`]).
3. Useful functionality hidden behind so called "internal" APIs that ought to be public.
4. APIs that are closed for modification yet offer no option for extension violating the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%E2%80%93closed_principle[_Open/Closed Principle_].
5. Utility/Helper classes containing functionality that ought to be part of the behavior exhibited by the types on which
the Utility/Helper classes operate (e.g. {apache-geode-javadoc}/org/apache/geode/cache/partition/PartitionRegionHelper.html[`PartitionRegionHelper`]).
6. Incorrect use of _Checked_ `Exceptions`
(e.g. {apache-geode-javadoc}/org/apache/geode/cache/IncompatibleVersionException.html[`IncompatibleVersionException`]).
7. Lingering deprecations.
8. ...

All of this plus much more makes using the {geode-name} API correctly difficult and confusing at times, especially
without prior knowledge or experience. Users very often get this wrong and it is the main reason why Spring's APIs for
{geode-name} are so invaluable; they can help you do the right thing!

Consider this, the one and only cache implementation (`GemFireCacheImpl`) implements both the `ClientCache` and `Cache`
interfaces. A `ClientCache` instance is created by client applications to access/persist data in a {geode-name} cluster.
On the contrary, a "peer" `Cache` instance is created by server-side applications serving as peer members of the
{geode-name} cluster (a.k.a. distributed system) to manage data. Both incarnations result in an instance of
`GemFireCacheImpl`, yet a cache cannot be both a client and a peer. But, you would never know this by introspecting
the cache instance.

The {apache-geode-javadoc}/org/apache/geode/Delta.html[`Delta`] interface, {apache-geode-javadoc}/org/apache/geode/Delta.html#hasDelta--[`hasDelta()`]
method is another point of confusion. If there is no delta, why send the object in its entirety? Presumably there are no
changes. Of course, there is a reason but it is not immediately apparent why!

Spring in general, and SBDG in particular, shield users from design problems as well as changes in {geode-name}'s APIs
that could adversely affect your applications when integrating with {geode-name}. Spring's APIs provide a layer of
indirection along with enhanced capabilities (e.g. Exception translation).

NOTE: Spring Data for {geode-name} (SDG) also {spring-data-geode-docs-html}/#apis[offers] some relief when working with
{geode-name}'s APIs.

[[geode-api-extensions-cacheresolver]]
=== `SimpleCacheResolver`

In some cases, it is necessary to acquire a reference to the cache instance in your application components at runtime.
For instance, you might want to create a temporary `Region` on the fly in order to aggregate data for analysis.

Typically, you already know the type of cache your application is using since you must declare your application to be
either a client (i.e. `ClientCache`) in the {apache-geode-docs}/topologies_and_comm/cs_configuration/chapter_overview.html[client/server topology],
or a {apache-geode-docs}/topologies_and_comm/p2p_configuration/chapter_overview.html[peer member/node] in the cluster
(i.e. `Cache`) on startup. This is expressed in configuration when creating the cache instance required to interact with
the {geode-name} data management system. In most cases, your application will be a client and SBDG makes this decision
easy since it _auto-configures_ a `ClientCache` instance, <<geode-clientcache-applications,by default>>.

In a Spring context, the cache instance created by the framework is a managed bean in the Spring Container. As such,
it is a simple matter to inject a reference to the _Singleton_ cache bean into any other managed application component.

Auto-wiring a Cache Reference using Dependency Injection (DI)
[source,java]
----
@Service
class CacheMonitoringService {

	@Autowired
    ClientCache clientCache;

    // use the clientCache object reference to monitor the cache as necessary

}
----

However, in cases where the application component or class is not managed by Spring, and you need a reference to the
cache instance at runtime, then SBDG provides the abstract `org.springframework.geode.cache.SimpleCacheResolver` class
(see {spring-boot-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/geode/cache/SimpleCacheResolver.html[Javadoc]).

.`SimpleCacheResolver` API
[source, java ]
----
package org.springframework.geode.cache;

abstract class SimpleCacheResolver {

	<T extends GemFireCache> T require() { }

	<T extends GemFireCache> Optional<T> resolve() { }

	Optional<ClientCache> resolveClientCache() { }

	Optional<Cache> resolvePeerCache() { }

}
----

`SimpleCacheResolver` adheres to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID[SOLID OO Principles]. This class is abstract and
extensible so users can change the algorithm used to resolve client or peer cache instances as well as mock the methods
in _Unit Tests_.

Additionally, each method is precise. For example, `resolveClientCache()` will only resolve a reference to a cache if
the cache instance is a "client"! If a cache exists but is a "peer" instance, then `resolveClientCache()` returns
`Optional.EMPTY`. The behavior of `resolvePeerCache()` is similar.

`require()` returns a non-`Optional` reference to a cache instance throwing an `IllegalStateException` if a cache
is not present.

[[geode-api-extensions-cacheutils]]
=== `CacheUtils`

Under-the-hood, the `SimpleCacheResolver` delegates some of its functions to the
{spring-boot-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/geode/util/CacheUtils.html[`CacheUtils`]
abstract utility class, which provides additional, convenient capabilities when working with a cache.

While there are utility methods to determine whether a cache instance (i.e. `GemFireCache`) or _Region_ is a client
or a peer, 1 of the more useful functions is to extract all the values from a _Region_.

To extract all the values stored in a _Region_ call `CacheUtils.collectValues(:Region<?, T>)`. This method returns a
`Collection<T>` containing all the values stored in the given _Region_.

The `collectValues(:Region<?, T>)` method is smart and knows how to handle either client or peer _Regions_. This
distinction is important since client `PROXY` _Regions_ store no values.

WARNING: Caution is advised when getting all values from a _Region_. While getting filtered reference values from a
non-transactional, reference-only data [`REPLICATE`] _Region_ is quite useful, getting values from a transactional,
[`PARTITION`] _Region_ can prove quite detrimental, especially in production.  Getting all values from a _Region_ is
also quite useful during testing.

[[geode-api-extensions-membership]]
=== `MembershipListenerAdapter` & `MembershipEvent`

Another useful API hidden by {geode-name} is the membership events and listener interface. This API is particularly
useful on the server-side when your Spring Boot application is serving as a peer member/node of the {geode-name}
distributed system.

When a peer member gets disconnected from the cluster, perhaps due to a network failure, the member is forcibly removed
from the distributed system. This node immediately enters a reconnecting state, trying to establish a connection back to
the cluster. Once reconnected, the peer member must rebuild all cache objects (i.e. `Cache`, `Regions`, `Indexes`,
`DiskStores`, etc). All old/previous cache objects are invalid and their references stale.

As you can imagine, in a Spring context this is particularly problematic since most {geode-name} objects are _Singleton_
beans declared in and managed by the Spring Container. Those beans maybe, and in many cases are, injected into framework
and application components. For instance, `Regions` are injected into SDG's `GemfireTemplate`, Spring Data _Repositories_
and possibly application-specific _Data Access Objects_ (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_access_object[DAO]).

If references to those cache objects become stale on a forced disconnect event, then there is no way to auto-wire fresh
object references into the dependent application or framework components when the peer member is reconnected unless the
Spring `ApplicationContext` is "refreshed". In fact, there is no way to even know that this event has occurred since the
{geode-name} `MembershipListener` API and corresponding events are "internal".

NOTE: The Spring team have explored the idea of creating proxies for all types of cache objects (i.e. `Cache`, `Regions`,
`Indexes`, `DiskStores`, `AsyncEventQueues`, `GatewayReceivers`, `GatewaySenders`, etc) used by Spring. The proxies
would know how to obtain a "fresh" reference on a reconnect event. However, this turns out to be more problematic than
it is worth. It is simply easier to "refresh" the Spring `ApplicationContext`, although no less cheap. Neither way is
ideal. See https://jira.spring.io/browse/SGF-921[SGF-921] and https://jira.spring.io/browse/SGF-227[SGF-227]
for further details.

In the situation where membership events are useful to the Spring Boot application, SBDG provides the following
{spring-boot-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/geode/distributed/event/package-frame.html[API]:

* {spring-boot-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/geode/distributed/event/MembershipListenerAdapter.html[`MembershipListenerAdapter`]
* {spring-boot-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/geode/distributed/event/MembershipEvent.html[`MembershipEvent`]

The abstract `MembershipListenerAdapter` class implements {geode-name}'s clumsy
`org.apache.geode.distributed.internal.MembershipListener` interface, simplifying the event handler method signatures
by using an appropriate `MembershipEvent` type to encapsulate the actors in the event.

The abstract `MembershipEvent` class is further subclassed to represent the specific membership event types that occur
within the {geode-name} system:

* {spring-boot-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/geode/distributed/event/support/MemberDepartedEvent.html[`MemberDepartedEvent`]
* {spring-boot-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/geode/distributed/event/support/MemberJoinedEvent.html[`MemberJoinedEvent`]
* {spring-boot-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/geode/distributed/event/support/MemberSuspectEvent.html[`MemberSuspectEvent`]
* {spring-boot-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/geode/distributed/event/support/QuorumLostEvent.html[`QuorumLostEvent`]

The API can be depicted in this UML diagram:

image::{images-dir}/membership-api-uml.png[]

The membership event type is further categorized with an appropriate enumerated value,
{spring-boot-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/geode/distributed/event/MembershipEvent.Type.html[`MembershipEvent.Type`],
as a property of the `MembershipEvent` itself (see {spring-boot-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/geode/distributed/event/MembershipEvent.html#getType--[`getType()`]).

The type hierarchy is useful in `instanceof` expressions while the `Enum` is useful in `switch` statements.

You can see 1 particular implementation of the `MembershipListenerAdapter` with the
{spring-boot-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/geode/distributed/event/ApplicationContextMembershipListener.html[`ApplicationContextMembershipListener`] class,
which does exactly as we described above, handling forced-disconnect/auto-reconnect membership events inside a
Spring context.

[[geode-api-extensions-pdx]]
=== PDX

{geode-name}'s PDX serialization framework is yet another API that falls short.

For instance, there is no easy or direct way to serialize an object as PDX bytes. It is also not possible to modify an
existing `PdxInstance` by adding or removing a field as it requires a new PDX type. In this case, you must create a new
`PdxInstance`, but unfortunately, the {geode-name} API offers no assistance when copying from an existing `PdxInstance`.

In such cases, SBDG provides the {spring-boot-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/geode/pdx/PdxInstanceBuilder.html[`PdxInstanceBuilder`]
class, appropriately named after the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern[_Builder Software Design Pattern_].
The `PdxInstanceBuilder` also offers a fluent API style for constructing `PdxInstances`.

.`PdxInstanceBuilder` API
[source,java]
----
class PdxInstanceBuilder {

	PdxInstanceFactory copy(PdxInstance pdx);

	Factory from(Object target);

}
----

For example, you could serialize an application domain object as PDX bytes with the following code:

.Object to PDX
[source,java]
----
@Component
class CustomerSerializer {

	PdxInstance serialize(Customer customer) {

		return PdxInstanceBuilder.create()
            .from(customer)
            .create();
	}
}
----

You could then modify the `PdxInstance` by copying from the original:

.Copy `PdxInstance`
[source,java]
----
@Component
class CustomerDecorator {

	@Autowired
    CustomerSerializer serializer;

	PdxIntance decorate(Customer customer) {

		PdxInstance pdxCustomer = serializer.serialize(customer);

		return PdxInstanceBuilder.create()
            .copy(pdxCustomer)
            .writeBoolean("vip", isImportant(customer))
            .create();
	}
}
----

SBDG also provides the {spring-boot-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/geode/pdx/PdxInstanceWrapper.html[`PdxInstanceWrapper`]
class to wrap an existing `PdxInstance` in order to provide more control during the conversion from PDX to JSON and back
into a POJO. Specifically, the wrapper gives users more control of the configuration of Jackson's `ObjectMapper`.

The `ObjectMapper` constructed by {geode-name}'s own `PdxInstance` implementation (`PdxInstanceImpl`) is not
configurable nor was it configured correctly. And unfortunately, since `PdxInstance` is not extensible, the `getObject()`
method fails miserably when converting the JSON generated from PDX back into a POJO for any practical application domain
model type.

.Wrapping an existing `PdxInstance`
[source,java]
----
PdxInstanceWrapper wrapper = PdxInstanceWrapper.from(pdxInstance);
----

For all operations on `PdxInstance` except `getObject()`, the wrapper delegates to the underlying `PdxInstance` method
implementation called by the user.

In addition to the decorated `getObject()` method, the `PdxInstanceWrapper` provides a thorough implementation of the
`toString()` method. The state of the `PdxInstance` is output in a JSON-like String.

WARNING: It is not currently possible to implement the `PdxInstance` interface and then store instances of this type as
a value in a _Region_.  {geode-name} naively assumes that all `PdxInstance` objects are an implementation created by
{geode-name} itself (i.e. `PdxInstanceImpl`), which has a tight coupling to the PDX type registry.

[[geode-api-extensions-security]]
=== Security

For testing purposes, SBDG provides a test implementation of {geode-name}'s {apache-geode-javadoc}/org/apache/geode/security/SecurityManager.html[`SecurityManager`]
interface that simply expects the password to match the username (case-sensitive) when authenticating.

By default, all operations are authorized.

To match the expectations of SBDG's `TestSecurityManager`, SBDG additionally provides a test implementation of
{geode-name}'s {apache-geode-javadoc}/org/apache/geode/security/AuthInitialize.html[`AuthInitialize`] interface that
supplies matching credentials for both the username and password.
